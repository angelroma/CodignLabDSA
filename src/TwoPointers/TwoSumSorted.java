     * Problem: Given a sorted array of unique integers and a target sum, find two numbers such that
     *          they add up to the target. Return their 1-based indices.
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
     * Output: [1,2]
     * Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9
     *
     * Example 2:
     * Input: nums = [1,3,4,5,7,10,11], target = 9
     * Output: [2,3]
     *
     * Constraints:
     * - 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
     * - -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
     * - nums is sorted in strictly increasing order.
     * - There is exactly one solution.
